# Subnet mapper in Go with Graph visualization
This project is a work-in-progress. **Network Gopher** is a small tool used to record the path of traffic and map it to a graph database. I am doing two implementations, one with https://github.com/cayleygraph and one with Neo4j. I am using this to evaluate a different Graph database engine (Neo4j is my daily driver) and work on my skills with Go and Graph Databases.

I am taking inspiration and ideas from:
